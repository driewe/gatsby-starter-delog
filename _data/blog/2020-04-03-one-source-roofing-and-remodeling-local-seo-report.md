When people in the DFW area search for home restoration type services how well is One Source Roofing and Remodeling performing in the search results? In order to test this, we need to have the proper proximity for the search and be using a search method that is not biased by the users browsing preferences. If you just open up a normal browser window and test the search then Google will give search results that are modified by your likes and dislikes. If you are the owner or the website or someone who has worked with it frequently then Google will give the site more value in the results than it would for a neutral party. How a site ranks for neutral parties is what counts.  Another thing I want to point out is the practice of testing local searches by putting a location qualifier is misleading because local customers are not using those and Google still knows the IP address of your ISP and will not give you accurate results.

In our test, we are using Bright Locals ranking software. This allows us to specify the search location and get accurate results for Google Desktop, Google Mobile, and Google Maps results. Bright Local also has a free search tool that allows you to [check your localized search rankings for any town, city or location regardless of your physical location](http://bit.ly/LocalizedSearchTool).

Below is a google spreadsheet containing 80 popular searches for home restoration services performed in the Denton County area.

## How To Improve Local SEO for One Source Roofing and Remodeling

I found several areas that are lacking in the local SEO for One Source Roofing and Remodeling.

### Onsite SEO Issues

The first thing I noticed was that the City Name and State Code are not in the title tag of the landing page. [According to MOZ](https://moz.com/local-search-ranking-factors) this is #20 on local SEO ranking factors and is an easy fix. I also noticed that the Title tag does not have the official business name “One Source Roofing and Remodeling” instead it has “One Source Restorations”.

### Citations

The second issue is citations. Our [Yext scan showed a 43% citation inconsistency for One Source Roofing and Remodeling](http://davidriewe.com/listing_scan/one-source-roofing-remodeling-online-directory-listing-report/). Yext has a direct API connection to 70+ directory listings and gives very accurate results.

A [Citation audit from Bright Local gives feedback](http://www.local-marketing-reports.com/citation-reports/bda809c27a22ca1bd07c006d6a5db3ca98cce0b6/843961#ct-top) on additional citations that should be considered.

## Which Citation Service Should I use?

Citations can be hand built or automated. On my [Denton SEO Experts](https://www.denton-seo.com/)site, I have 115 active citations. 70 of those citations are managed by Yext which ensures the accuracy of the listings and allows me to manage [Products & Services](https://www.denton-seo.com/denton-seo-services/), Bios, Menus & Events for those listings from one common place and make updates as needed. The other 45 were hand built and all 115 are visible in my Bright Local Citation Report.

A strategy used in conventional SEO that works in Local SEO is to look at what the top competitors are doing and copy that. In the Google My Business report below we have the top 10 competitors for 5 searches. The report will show us information about their Citations, inbound links, website authority, number of reviews and average ratings. Comparing these we can get insights to where we need to focus first to strengthen up our local SEO. The report also has a Citation matrix where we can see what citations the competition has that we do not have.

## Summary

Onesource Roofing and remodeling should correct its title tag to have its official name, as listed in their Google My Business profile, along with including the City and State code. Next, I would implement a citation clean up and build a campaign. Personally, I would recommend using Yext on the 70 it controls then order a citation campaign on those that Yext does not control. This should show some improved results in the local rankings within 30 – 45 days.

At the same time, a review campaign should be implemented to increase the number of reviews. Yext has built-in features for assisting in generating reviews, both 1st party on the business website and third party.

Currently, One Source Roofing and Remodeling has 15 pages on their website. It looks like they have recently started adding more content to the blog since August of this year. I would continue that path and look for ways to incorporate topics on the search phrases that they are not currently ranking on. Also, add some social sharing buttons to the blog posts to make it easier for readers to share and make sure that when new posts are created they are shared out on social media channels such as Facebook, Twitter, Google+, Pinterest, etc.

Finally, I would implement a back linking strategy. Quality backlinks are essential in both organic SEO and local SEO. Getting quality backlinks involves finding quality sites that are relevant to your industry and finding a way to reach out to them such that they link back to you all while staying within Google’s webmaster guidelines
